Wrangle and Analyze "WeRateDog" Twitter Account Data

# Introduction

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called **data wrangling**. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using **Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL**.

# Dataset

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as **WeRateDogs**. **WeRateDogs** is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

**WeRateDogs** downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

# Jupyter Notebook for Wrangling and Visualization Effort

# Wrangle Summary

Create a 300-600 word written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.

# Insights and Visualizations

Create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf or act_report.html that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article, for example.
